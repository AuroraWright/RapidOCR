## Introduction
- Completely open source, free and support offline deployment of multi-platform and multi-language OCR SDK
- **Chinese Advertising**: Welcome to join our QQ group to download the model and test program, QQ group number: 887298230
- **Cause**: Baidu paddlepaddle engineering is not very good, in order to facilitate everyone to perform OCR reasoning on various terminals, we convert it to onnx format, use ``python/c++/java/swift/c#'' to change It is ported to various platforms.

- **Name Source**: Light, fast, economical and smart. OCR technology based on deep learning technology focuses on artificial intelligence advantages and small models, with speed as the mission and effect as the leading role.

- Based on Baidu's open source PaddleOCR model and training, anyone can use this inference library, or use Baidu's paddlepaddle framework for model optimization according to their own needs.

## Recently updates

#### ðŸŽƒ 2021-10-27 update
- Add the code that uses the onnxruntime GPU version of infering follow the [official tutorial](https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/execution-providers/CUDA-ExecutionProvider.html) Configuration. (however, the onnxruntime GPU version is not stable to use) 

- See: [onnxruntime GPU inference configuration](#Python/README.md) for specific steps.

#### 2021-09-13 update
- Add a whl file based on `Python` for ease of use. See [release/python](#release/python) for details.

#### 2021-09-11 update
- Add `PP-OCRv2` new model onnx version.
- The infering code of the method is unchanged, and the corresponding model can be directly replaced.
- After evaluation on its own test set:
    - The effect of `PP-OCRv2` detection model has been greatly improved, and the model size has not changed.
    - The effect of `PP-OCRv2` recognition model was not significantly improved, and the model size increased by 3.58M.

- Upload the model to [Baidu online disk extraction code: 30jv](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1qkqWK4wRdMjqGGbzR-FyWg) or [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1x_a9KpCo_1blxH1xFOfgKVkw1HYRVywY?usp=sharing)

#### 2021-08-07 update
- TODO:
    - [ ] PP structure table structure and cell coordinate prediction are being sorted out.

- Previously done, unfinished, welcome to PR
    - [ ] make dokcer image
    - [x] try onnxruntime GPU reasoning


<details>
    <summary>Previous update logs</summary>

#### 2021-07-17 update
- Improve the README document
- Add **English, number recognition**onnx model, please refer to `python/en_number_ppocr_mobile_v2_rec` for details, the usage is the same as others
- Organize [Model to onnx](#model-related)

#### 2021-07-04 update
- The python program under the repository can be successfully run on the Raspberry Pi 4B. For more information, please enter the QQ group and ask the group owner
- Update the overall structure diagram and add support for Raspberry Pi

#### 2021-06-20 update
- Optimize the display of recognition results in ocrweb, and add recognition animations to demonstrate at the same time
- Update the `datasets` directory, add some commonly used database links

#### 2021-06-10 update
- Add server version text recognition model, see details [Extract codeï¼š30jv](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1qkqWK4wRdMjqGGbzR-FyWg)

#### 2021-06-08 update
- Organize the warehouse and unify the model download path
- Improve related documentation

#### 2021-03-24 update
- The new model is fully compatible with ONNXRuntime 1.7 or higher. Special thanks: @Channingss
- The performance of the new version of onnxruntime is improved by more than 40% compared to 1.6.0.

## [FAQ](FAQ.md)

## SDK compilation status
Since ubuntu users are all commercial users and have the ability to compile, pre-compiled packages are not provided for the time being, and they can be compiled by themselves.

| Platform | Compilation Status | Offer Status |
| --------------- | -------- | -------- |
| Windows x86/x64 | [![CMake-windows-x86-x64](https://github.com/RapidOCR/RapidOCR/actions/workflows/windows-all-build.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/RapidOCR/RapidOCR/actions/workflows/windows-all-build.yaml) | [Download Link](https://github.com/RapidAI/RapidOCR/releases) |
| Linux x64 | [![CMake-linux](https://github.com/RapidOCR/RapidOCR/actions/workflows/make-linux.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/RapidOCR/RapidOCR/actions/workflows/make-linux.yml) | Not available yet, compile by yourself |

## Online demo
- [Web demo](http://rapidocr.51pda.cn:9003/)
- The model combination used in the demo is: **server det** + **mobile cls** + **mobile rec**
