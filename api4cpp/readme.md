It's only a wrapper for cpp version. 

We give it a set of pure C interface APIs for CPP project, so that you can call the APIs in your server or client end APP.


To start, you should open the CMakeLists.txt from the root directory with Visual studio 2019 or CMAKE directly.

About files in this directory:


aipiaoocr_api.cpp      : the implementation of APIs


bpocrapitest.cpp      : the tester
