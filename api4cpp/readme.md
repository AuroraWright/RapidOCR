It's only a wrapper for cpp version. 

We give it a set of pure C interface for CPP project, so that you can call the API in your server or client end APP.


To start, you should open the CMakeLists.txt from the root directory.

About files in this directory:


aipiaoocr_api.cpp      : the implementation of APIs


bpocrapitest.cpp      : the tester
